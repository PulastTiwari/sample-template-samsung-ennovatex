# Source

This repository follows the Samsung EnnovateX template. The source code for the project is organized in the following folders in the repository root (instead of nesting them directly under `src/` to preserve project structure):

- `frontend/` — Next.js application (UI, dashboard, classify pages)
- `backend/` — FastAPI service and orchestrator

For evaluation, reviewers should inspect `frontend/` and `backend/` directories for the runnable source code. Both folders include setup and run instructions in their respective READMEs.
